Over the past decade, graphic designers have been using web technologies for typesetting and layout of printed publications. These approaches, rooted in the culture of free software and open-source, have raised conceptual, political, and aesthetic issues for graphic design. This research aims to understand the impact of code on graphic designers’ practices and how this technical change contributes to the construction and development of a community of practice.

The study adopts an anthropocentric understanding of technique, using the cultural-historical theory of activity and the instrumental approach to investigate the activity of composition and its development, as well as the associated sociotechnical system changes. Moreover, from a research perspective carried by practice, we mobilize our own experience as graphic designer registered within a community of actors leading these transformations.

Through three empirical studies and the collective design of a tool called paged.js, which enables the creation of printed books from web browsers, the study examines the composition activity from multiple perspectives. The results are analyzed in relation to broader questions about the sociotechnical transformations brought about by the integration of open source software practices in graphic design. The study argues that the use of web technologies in the graphic design process supports the creative and aesthetic practices of designers, and opens up new opportunities for collective activity, enabling the community to develop its own tools and practices.
